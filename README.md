# OminousChestLock

![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/lheQ9q9.png)

Paper plugin (1.21.0–1.21.11+) and Fabric server mod (1.21.11) that locks chests, double chests, barrels, and shulker boxes to a named Ominous or regular Trial Key, with optional lockpicking.

## How it works
- Rename an ominous trial key in an anvil (example: `secretkeyname`).
- Right-click a chest, barrel, or shulker box while holding that key to lock it.
- Only players holding a matching named key can open, break, or otherwise interact with the locked container.
- Locks are key-name based, not player based. Keys can be stolen or copied.
- One key name can only lock one container at a time until that container is unlocked/destroyed.
- Optional: normal trial keys can be enabled. The first successful open with a normal key arms the lock; the next successful open consumes the key and permanently unlocks the container.

Vault sounds are used for success/failure feedback.

## Lock picking

![Crafting](https://i.imgur.com/7i5efl9.png)

Three lock picks can be crafted and used to pick locked containers when you do not have the correct key. Attempts and lockouts are tracked per pick type, using the configured lockout scope.

- Rusty pick: `copper ingot + tripwire hook + stick`, default 100% break chance, 5% open chance (10% on normal-key locks).
- Normal pick: `iron ingot + tripwire hook + breeze rod`, default 50% break chance, 10% open chance (20% on normal-key locks).
- Silence pick: `normal pick + silence trim + echo shard` in a smithing table, default 5% break chance, 50% base open chance. After lockout, each attempt halves the chance; the penalty resets after the configured time.

Lockout limit is a random roll between `lockpicks.limit.min` and `lockpicks.limit.max` (inclusive). The roll happens on the first pick attempt for that pick type and is stored on the lock until it is unlocked/destroyed.

Lockout scope can be set to `chest` (shared across all players) or `player` (each player has their own lockout/attempts) via `lockpicks.lockout-scope`.

On failed attempts, the player takes damage (defaults: 0.5/1/2 hearts for rusty/normal/silence). Rusty/normal picks play chest-locked sounds, then vault deactivate on lockout and vault hit on further attempts. Silence picks only play a sound on the lockout (vault deactivate), then vault hit until the penalty reset.

### Resource pack
Item model overrides and textures are provided in `src/main/resources/resourcepack`. Use this folder as a resource pack to see the lock pick textures in-hand and in inventories.

A prepackaged zip will be provided in the releases page along with the compiled binary of this plugin.

## Data
Lock data is stored in `plugins/OminousChestLock/data.yml`. Entries include the key name, creator, and last user. If enabled, it will also show information about who tried to pick the lock as well as information about their attempt.

Unlocked chests are removed from the ```data.yml```.

Existing entries from older versions are automatically read and upgraded when saved.

Example:
```yaml
locked-chests:
  test:-8,104,40:
    key: key2
    world:
      name: test
      realm: OVERWORLD
      uuid: 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
    creator:
      name: Billy
      uuid: 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
    last-user:
      name: Tito
      uuid: 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
    pick:
      last:
        name: CevAPI
        uuid: 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
        type: silence
        timestamp: 1767877437911
      silence:
        limit: 2
        attempts: 3
        over-limit-attempts: 3
        penalty-timestamp: 1767877437911
```

- `/chestlock unlock` - Force unlock the looked-at container.
- `/chestlock keyinfo` - Show the locked container location and owner info for the key in hand.
- `/chestlock reload` - Reload lock data from disk.
- `/chestlock loglevel <0-3>` - Set log verbosity.
- `/chestlock normalkeys <on|off>` - Allow normal trial keys.
- `/chestlock lockpicks <on|off>` - Allow lock picking and crafting.
- `/chestlock lockoutscope <chest|player>` - Set lockout scope.
- `/chestlock give <player> <rusty|normal|silence> [amount]` - Give lock picks to a player.
- `/chestlock help` - Show help.

## Config
Config in `plugins/OminousChestLock/config.yml`:
- `logging.level`:
  - `0` = nothing
  - `1` = everything (includes lock pick successes and failures)
  - `2` = failed unlock + destruction/automation attempts (includes lock pick failures)
  - `3` = destruction/automation attempts only
- `keys.allow-normal`:
  - `false` = ominous keys only
  - `true` = ominous + normal trial keys
- `lockpicks.enabled`:
  - `false` = lock pick crafting/usage disabled
  - `true` = lock pick crafting/usage enabled
- `lockpicks.limit.min` / `lockpicks.limit.max`:
  - Random attempt limit (inclusive) before lockout per pick type
  - The limit is rolled once on the first pick attempt for that pick type and then stored on that locked container until it is unlocked/destroyed
- `lockpicks.lockout-scope`:
  - `chest` = pick lockout is shared by all players on that container
  - `player` = pick lockout is tracked separately per player
- `lockpicks.rusty.*`, `lockpicks.normal.*`, `lockpicks.silence.*`:
  - `open-chance` = base success chance (0.0–1.0)
  - `normal-key-chance` = success chance for normal-key locks (rusty/normal only)
  - `break-chance` = break chance per attempt (0.0–1.0)
  - `damage` = hearts of damage per failed attempt
  - `penalty-reset-minutes` = silence pick over-limit reset time (minutes)

Example:
```yaml
logging:
  # 0 = nothing, 1 = everything, 2 = failed + destruction/automation, 3 = destruction/automation only
  level: 1
keys:
  # false = ominous trial keys only, true = ominous + normal trial keys
  allow-normal: true
lockpicks:
  # true = allow lock pick crafting and usage
  enabled: true
  # random attempt limit before lockout
  limit:
    min: 1
    max: 20
  # lockout scope: "chest" = shared for all players, "player" = per-player lockout tracking
  lockout-scope: chest
  rusty:
    open-chance: 0.05
    normal-key-chance: 0.1
    break-chance: 1.0
    damage: 1.0
  normal:
    open-chance: 0.1
    normal-key-chance: 0.2
    break-chance: 0.5
    damage: 2.0
  silence:
    open-chance: 0.5
    break-chance: 0.05
    damage: 4.0
    # time until over-limit penalty resets
    penalty-reset-minutes: 60
```
