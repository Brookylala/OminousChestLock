# OminousChestLock

Paper plugin for Minecraft 1.21.0-1.21.11+ that locks chests, double chests, barrels, and shulker boxes to a named ominous trial key and optionally allows players to lock-pick them!

## How it works
- Rename an ominous trial key in an anvil (example: `secretkeyname`).
- Right-click a chest, barrel, or shulker box while holding that key to lock it.
- Only players holding a matching named key can open, break, or otherwise interact with the locked container.
- Locks are key-name based, not player based. Keys can be stolen or copied.
- One key name can only lock one container at a time until that container is unlocked/destroyed.
- Optional: normal trial keys can be enabled. The first successful open with a normal key arms the lock; the next successful open consumes the key and permanently unlocks the container.

Vault sounds are used for success/failure feedback.

## Lock picking

Three lock picks can be crafted and used to pick locked containers when you do not have the correct key. Pick attempts are tracked per lock and pick tier.

- Rusty pick: `copper ingot + tripwire hook + stick`, 100% break chance, 5% open chance (10% on normal-key locks). Over-limit attempts always fail.
- Normal pick: `iron ingot + tripwire hook + breeze rod`, 50% break chance, 10% open chance (20% on normal-key locks). Over-limit attempts always fail.
- Silence pick: `normal pick + silence trim + echo shard` in a smithing table, 2% break chance, 50% base open chance. After the limit, each attempt halves the chance; the penalty resets after 1 hour.

On failed attempts, the player takes damage (0.5/1/2 hearts for rusty/normal/silence). Rusty/normal picks play chest-locked sounds, then vault deactivate on lockout and vault hit on further attempts. Silence picks only play a sound on the lockout (vault deactivate), then vault hit until the 1-hour reset.

### Resource pack
Item model overrides and textures are provided in `src/main/resources/resourcepack`. Use this folder as a resource pack to see the lock pick textures in-hand and in inventories.

A prepackaged zip will be provided in the releases page along with the compiled binary of this plugin.

## Data
Lock data is stored in `plugins/OminousChestLock/data.yml`. Entries include the key name, creator, and last user.
Existing entries from older versions are automatically read and upgraded when saved.

Example:
```yaml
locked-chests:
  world:10,64,20:
    key: secretkeyname
    world:
      name: world
      realm: OVERWORLD
      uuid: 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
    creator:
      name: Bingo
      uuid: 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
    last-user:
      name: Steve
      uuid: fedcba98-7654-3210-cake-ba9876543210
```

## Config
Config in `plugins/OminousChestLock/config.yml`:
- `logging.level`:
  - `0` = nothing

  - `2` = failed unlock + destruction/automation attempts (includes lock pick failures)
  - `3` = destruction/automation attempts only
- `keys.allow-normal`:
  - `false` = ominous keys only
  - `true` = ominous + normal trial keys
- `lockpicks.enabled`:
  - `false` = lock pick crafting/usage disabled
  - `true` = lock pick crafting/usage enabled
- `lockpicks.limit.min` / `lockpicks.limit.max`:
  - Random attempt limit (inclusive) before lockout per pick type
  - The limit is rolled once on the first pick attempt for that pick type and then stored on that locked container until it is unlocked/destroyed
- `lockpicks.lockout-scope`:
  - `chest` = pick lockout is shared by all players on that container
  - `player` = pick lockout is tracked separately per player
- `lockpicks.rusty.*`, `lockpicks.normal.*`, `lockpicks.silence.*`:
  - `open-chance` = base success chance (0.0–1.0)
  - `normal-key-chance` = success chance for normal-key locks (rusty/normal only)
  - `break-chance` = break chance per attempt (0.0–1.0)
  - `damage` = hearts of damage per failed attempt
  - `penalty-reset-minutes` = silence pick over-limit reset time (minutes)
